# Hooks — deterministic complements for AgentRX

Hooks are still important in the new architecture, but their role is now more precise.

This project distinguishes between:

- problems that require **model judgment**
- problems that should be handled by **deterministic control**

## Core principle

Use a hook when the action must happen **every time** and should not depend on the model choosing correctly.

Use the diagnosis layer when the agent must reason about:
- task framing
- tool fit
- capability tradeoffs
- output quality
- recovery strategy

## Hook vs diagnosis layer

| Situation | Better fit |
|---|---|
| Command exits non-zero | Hook |
| Permission denied | Hook first, diagnosis second |
| Output looks wrong for the user’s real intent | Diagnosis layer |
| Agent is unsure which tool family to choose | Diagnosis layer |
| Task should always run before deploy/commit/send | Hook / workflow |
| Same task sometimes uses a skill and sometimes an MCP with unpredictable results | Diagnosis layer |
| Security, lint, policy checks | Hook / workflow |
| Need to explain why the current path is the wrong tool for a dynamic/login page | Diagnosis layer |

## Updated role of hooks

Hooks should now be thought of as:

1. **Signal collectors** — capture deterministic failure facts.
2. **Intake helpers** — prefill parts of the intake card.
3. **Guardrails** — enforce actions that must never be optional.

A hook should not try to replace the entire diagnosis layer.

## Recommended hook outputs

When a hook fires, it should ideally emit structured signals that help populate the **evidence** section of the intake card:

| Schema path | Hook responsibility |
|---|---|
| `evidence.symptom` | Capture the raw deterministic failure fact |
| `evidence.attempted_path.tool` | Which tool was invoked |
| `evidence.attempted_path.tool_type` | Tool type (skill, mcp, builtin, etc.) |
| `evidence.environment` | Platform, requires_* booleans |
| `evidence.context` | Additional situation context |
| `evidence.reproduction_steps` | What was already tried |
| `evidence.failed_step` | Specific step that failed |

**Hooks are responsible for prefilling evidence only.** They do not produce inference. Only when signals are completely deterministic and involve no model judgment may a hook supplement minimal classification hints — but this is the exception, not the rule.

## Good examples

### Tool execution hook
Use when:
- a command crashes
- stderr clearly shows permission or dependency failure

The hook should:
- capture raw deterministic facts
- classify obvious environment/config signals
- pass the event into the diagnosis layer as a partially completed intake card

### Workflow boundary hook
Use when:
- a step must always happen
- missing the step creates unacceptable risk

Examples:
- secret scanning
- policy checks
- deployment safeguards
- mandatory formatting/linting
- audit logging

## Bad use of a hook

Do not use a hook as a crude replacement for task reasoning.

For example:
- “Always use browser tool X for browsing” is usually too rigid.
- The better question is whether the task requires:
  - static fetch
  - dynamic render
  - login state
  - local browser session
  - deterministic scraping

That routing choice belongs in the diagnosis layer.

## Implemented hooks

### `tool_error_intake_prefill.sh`

Generates an intake skeleton JSON when a tool execution fails.

**Usage:**
```bash
./hooks/tool_error_intake_prefill.sh <task> <tool_name> <tool_type> <failed_step> <symptom>
```

**Prefills:**
- `task`
- `attempted_path.tool`
- `attempted_path.tool_type`
- `symptom`
- `failed_step`
- `environment.platform`

The agent completes the remaining fields (desired_outcome, inference, etc.).

**Example:**
```bash
./hooks/tool_error_intake_prefill.sh \
  "browse-web" "web_fetch" "builtin" \
  "Static HTML fetch returned page skeleton" \
  "Page content missing, requires JavaScript rendering"
```

## Migration note

Legacy hook docs assumed the repo was mostly about “skill failures.”  
That is no longer the right frame.

Hooks are now part of a broader model:

`deterministic facts -> intake card -> task-first diagnosis -> next action`
